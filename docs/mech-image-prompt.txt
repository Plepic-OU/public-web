Nano Banana Image Prompt — Plepic Mech Visual
===============================================

Generate a Starcraft-inspired SCV / mech vehicle illustration for use as a hero visual on a dark retro-futuristic tech website.

Style:
- Dark background (#050508 to #0a0a12 gradient), matching a space/void aesthetic
- Retro-futuristic, military sci-fi art direction inspired by Starcraft Terran units
- Clean vector-style or semi-realistic digital illustration
- Matte metallic body with subtle panel lines and rivet details

Color palette:
- Primary accent: Cyan (#00FFFF) — used for HUD elements, visor glow, energy lines
- Secondary accent: Orange (#FF9800) — used for warning lights, exhaust glow, status indicators
- Body: Dark gunmetal grays with subtle cyan edge lighting
- Background: Deep space black with faint cyan grid lines (50px spacing, very subtle)

Subject:
- A humanoid mech/exosuit (think Starcraft SCV meets a piloted combat frame)
- Cockpit/visor area clearly visible, showing a human pilot silhouette inside
- The pilot's hands are on controls — emphasize "human in command" not "autonomous robot"
- Proportions: stocky, utilitarian, built for work not warfare
- Tool arms: one arm has a code terminal/holographic display, the other has a multi-tool appendage

Details:
- HUD overlay elements floating near the mech: "LLM LOOP ACTIVE", status bars, a circular arrow icon
- Faint scanline overlay across the entire image (2px repeating horizontal lines at 10% opacity)
- Subtle particle effects — small cyan dots drifting upward like data points
- "PLEPIC" stenciled on the mech's shoulder plate in Orbitron-style font
- Small "CLAUDE CODE" badge/decal on the chest plate

Composition:
- 3/4 front view, slightly from below (heroic angle)
- Mech centered, facing slightly right
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 3:2 for hero banner use
- Leave negative space on the left for text overlay

Do NOT include:
- Weapons, guns, or military insignia
- Anime/manga styling
- Bright or saturated backgrounds
- Generic robot/android look — this should feel industrial and utilitarian
